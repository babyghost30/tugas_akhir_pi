			<td><p align="justify">In programming and hacking culture, a script kiddie or skiddie is an 
			unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others 
			to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites. It is generally 
			assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability 
			to write sophisticated programs or exploits on their own and that their 
			objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast 
			communities. However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant. 
			The term is considered to be somewhat offensive.[citation needed]</p><p align="right"><a href="index.html"><- Back </a></p></td>
